# Multithreaded Proxy Web Server in C
A simple proxy web server built in C to understand core networking and multithreading concepts.

## What is this project about?
This is just a hobby project I built in my free time to understand and implement some core web concepts. Through this project, I learned:
* How web requests work from our local computer to servers
* How servers handle multiple client requests at once
* How thread locking works for concurrent operations
* How browser caching works and why it matters
